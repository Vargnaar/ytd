# You Tube Downloader

### *So simple, it's stupid.*

Usage:
```bash
python3 ytd.py

# Follow the easy to follow but annoyingly formatted prompts!

```

## Latest Features:
- Video renaming (It actually doesn't help to hide the second copy of LotR YTP 2010 collection effectively)

- Printed output looking cleaner with highlighting and different colours (Banners just aren't wanky enough, now with bright red!)

- Choose between video or just audio (Lex Friedman is wonderful background noise)

- Funky new banner (I added one line)

- Link checking via title (Are you sure you wanted chainsaw ASMR 4k 24fps recoloured?)

- Cleanup feature (You already have a copy of How to sell your bathwater online, do you want it again?)

- The banner is so neat that it needed to be mentioned twice (and is now featured twice!)

  
  ## Coming soon:
- Quality selection

- Playlist downloader
