# You Tube Downloader

### *So stupid, it's simple.*

Usage:
```bash
# Install necessary libraries
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
# Run the script
python3 ytd.py
# Follow the easy to follow but annoyingly formatted prompts!

```

## Latest Features:
- Quality selection (Works but audio-only downloads show 4 "None" options. They all work as the same default quality)

- Video renaming (It actually doesn't help to hide the second copy of LotR YTP 2010 collection effectively)

- Printed output looking cleaner with highlighting and different colours (Banners just aren't wanky enough, now with bright red!)

- Choose between video or just audio (Lex Friedman is wonderful background noise)

- Funky new banner (I added one line)

- Link checking via title (Are you sure you wanted chainsaw ASMR 4k 24fps recoloured?)

- Cleanup feature (You already have a copy of How to sell your bathwater online, do you want it again?)

- The banner is so neat that it needed to be mentioned twice (and is now featured twice!)

  
## Coming soon:
- Command line arguments so you can cut to the chase
!(carbon example)[https://github.com/Vargnaar/ytd/blob/clia/carbon-example.png]

- Playlist downloader

- Threads? (likely not)

## Minor Updates:
- Updoot script usage example to reflooct the noo 1 (respectively)

- Added a requirements.txt for you to pip

- Fixed some formatting issues

- Added more colour for easier reading

- Verbiage update to conserve... something idk
